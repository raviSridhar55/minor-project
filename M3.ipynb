After reading all the bad reviews, I thought I would contribute. When I first had it inserted, I had light spotting for about three weeks. I don&#039;t get my period or any spotting now-the last time I got my period was March 2014. Gaining weight was a huge concern for me when debating whether I should get it or not, but I haven&#039;t had that much weight gain-I contribute it more to my college diet but I also work out a lot.

I then opted to get the nexplanon implant and unlike my IUD experience, it was almost completely painless - just a pinch. With getting the nexplanon, I had a few concerns: 1. That my acne would come back (my birth control pills greatly controlled my acne) 2. That I wouldn&#039;t stop spotting. At the beginning, I only spotted for 2-3 weeks. After a month, I would get monthly very very light periods (3 days) and after 3 months, I lost my period. I get slight mood swings but no acne or weight gain.

With little to no effort at all I&#039;ve gained 45lbs, zero sex drive, horrible mood swings with periods of depression. I bled for about a month after I got it put in and have no had a period ever since. I get all the symptoms that I&#039;m going to start my period but no menstruation ever occurs. Every now and then the part of my arm where the rod was inserted with ache badly.While I think this form of contraception works great for some people, I do not think it works for me at all. It feels like the symptoms are only getting worse.\"'],\n",
